This repository contains a collection of the worksheets and projects I completed during the learning, and development of my Python coding skills with futureCoders.

The *Worksheets* folder contains a number of worksheets that I completed that first introduced me to the Python coding language and then allowed me to develop and hone my skills and knowledge of Python to utalise it in data analysis.

### The *Projects* folder contains a number of projects I completed during my learning:
- Air Quality (mini project) - I worked with data on Air Quality, I investigated, cleaned and wrangled the data and summarised datasets relating to Air Quality.

- NumPy (mini project) - I investigated, wrangled, added additional new data to the dataframe, filtered and correlated data series relating to exam scores.

- Sea Level project - I have worked with data on rising sea levels, cleaned it and visualised it, and I have used linear regression to help to predict sea levels up to 2050.

- -NumPy Sea Level Project - Using NumPy, I looked for a correlation between time data and the sea level rise.
